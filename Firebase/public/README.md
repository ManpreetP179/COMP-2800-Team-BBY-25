# COMP-2800-Team-BBY-25
This is our read me file.

Team 25:

Team members:
Prerna, Manreet Kaur, Manpreet Parmar, Harjot Binning.

Our Repo:
-We have separate branches for different features.
-In order to avoid conflicts, we made a dev branch in which all the features were combined.
-The dev branch was merged into the master branch which is hosted on the server.


As we have chat feature in our applicaiton, it requires firebase SDK that needs to be configured and imported.
