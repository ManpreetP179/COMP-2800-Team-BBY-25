# COMP-2800-Team-BBY-25
This is our read me file.

Our Repo:
- We have separate branches for different features.
- In order to avoid conflicts, we made a dev branch in which all the features were combined.
- The dev branch was merged into the master branch which is hosted on the server.

Development Environment:
- As we have chat feature in our applicaiton, it requires firebase SDK that needs to be configured and   imported.

3rd Party API:
1. Twitter 
2. covid 19 map

Configurations (Database credentials or server password):
We have used firebase as our database, so we don't need any server password to access it.
